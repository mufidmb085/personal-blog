Cockfighting is a custom that found in many cultures, including those in Southeast Asia. Although this custom has a long and significant history within cultural context, it remains a controversial issue today. The controversy primarily stems from its association with gambling and cruelty towards animals. This writing tries to explore the history, practice and legal status of cockfighting especially in Southeast Asian, while also examining the controversy.

## Cockfighting as a customs
Cockfighting has deeps cultural roots in many societies, particularly in Southeast Asia such as Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand. Historically, cockfighting was often more than just a form of entertainment; it also served as a means to show honor and bravery. The roosters used in these fights were frequently cared for with great attention, regarded as status symbols, and in many cultures, were even believed to possess supernatural powers.

In Indonesia, cockfighting still found in some region, particularly in deep-rooted customs. For example, in Bali, cockfighting — locally known as tajen — is practiced as a part of religious ritual, called tabuh rah, a blood offering in Hindu ceremonies intended to exorcise evil spirit. However, under Indonesian animal welfare laws, cockfighting is illegal and prohibited.

Also, Philippines has deep-rooted customs surrounding, locally known as sabong, it’s still practiced today. In fact, cockfighting in Philippines is legal under specific regulations, and is frequently conducted in official arenas, often accompanied by betting. Sabong in Philippines represents more than just a form of entertainment; it is also considered as a part of national identity and serves a significant source of incomes for many people.

In Thailand, cockfighting has a long history and continues to be practiced, albeit with stricter regulations. Rural Thai communities continue to maintain the tradition, often accompanied by betting, despite government efforts to control the illegal gambling that accompanies it.

## Controversy and criticism
While cockfighting has an important place in some cultures, the practice is not without controversy. Animal rights organizations such as PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) condemn cockfighting as a form of animal abuse. The main criticism is that cockfighting involves unnecessary suffering, with animals forced to fight to the point of severe injury or death for human entertainment.

In addition to animal cruelty, the gambling element of cockfighting is often a serious social problem. In some areas, cockfighting involves large bets, which can sometimes lead to economic ruin for the losing gamblers. Historical texts on cockfighting in Sumatra, for example, mention that parents would gamble their wives, children, or other family members when they lost their property. This phenomenon shows how cockfighting can go beyond entertainment and turn into a dangerous form of gambling that destroys the lives of many.

## Status and law enforcement
Although cockfighting is illegal in many countries, the practice continues, often clandestinely. In some remote areas or highly traditional societies, cockfighting remains a cultural heritage and is difficult to eradicate. Governments often face challenges in eradicating cockfighting, especially because of the cultural and economic elements associated with the practice.

In Indonesia, cockfighting is technically illegal, but the practice persists in some remote areas or in the context of religious rituals such as in Bali. Law enforcement is often limited, especially in areas far from the center of power. In the Philippines, cockfighting is legal with strict controls, although illegal cockfighting also occurs outside of formal arenas. In Thailand, the government has introduced stricter regulations to reduce the illegal gambling that often accompanies cockfighting, but the tradition still lives on in rural areas.

## So…
Cockfighting is a complex practice, with deep custom roots in some countries, yet a subject of global controversy. While legal and regulated in some countries such as the Philippines, in others, cockfighting is considered a form of animal cruelty and is banned. The practice has faced strong criticism from animal rights groups who see it as barbaric and inhumane. Amidst all this, the challenge of enforcing illegal cockfighting continues, especially in areas where cockfighting is part of their tradition and cultural heritage.

Cockfighting, with all its cultural, economic and social aspects, remains a controversial phenomenon in many countries. On the one hand, it is seen as a cultural heritage that must be preserved, while on the other, it is seen as a brutal form of gambling that is inappropriate in a modern society that values ​​animal welfare.
