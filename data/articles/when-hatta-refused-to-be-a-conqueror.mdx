title: "When Hatta Refused to Be a Conqueror"
author: "Mufid Muhammad Baihaqi"

excerpt: "In a pivotal meeting that would shape the nation, Hatta stood alone—rejecting Papua’s inclusion into Indonesia, rejecting aggressive nationalism, and insisting that citizens be treated as human beings, not just people with obligations. His views were dismissed by almost everyone at the time. But today, his quiet voice rings the clearest."

On **July 10th, 1945**, BPUPKI (the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Indonesian Independence) was holding a meeting. Present were Soepomo, Sukarno, Agus Salim, Mohammad Yamin, and of course, Hatta.

During that session, **Hatta spoke coolly and without pleasantries**:

> *"I cannot yet accept it, because if we examine it from a scientific point of view, science always begins with doubt. Only when there is overwhelming, concrete evidence that the Papuan people are of the same nation as us will I be willing to accept it. But for now, I can only acknowledge that the Papuans are a Melanesian people."*

It wasn’t just Papua—**Hatta also firmly rejected the inclusion of Malaya and North Borneo** (present-day Malaysia) into the territory of Indonesia. He only wanted to accept the former Dutch East Indies, minus Papua.

Unsurprisingly, **Hatta's view was overwhelmingly rejected** by the rest of BPUPKI. Only six members supported his proposal; the other 39 agreed to include Papua (along with Aceh and Timor) within Indonesia's future territory.

Of course, we can’t blame those 39 members for the long trail of human rights abuses that would later unfold in **Aceh, Timor, and Papua**—especially during the New Order era. But regardless, it was they who helped forge the consensus that brought these three regions into Indonesia.

## A Warning Against Imperialistic Nationalism
There is another important note worth underlining:

**Hatta was the only one during the BPUPKI meetings who warned of the dangers of chauvinistic nationalism**—a nationalism that idolizes unity above all else. He explicitly stated:

> *"What worries me most is the discussion around Papua, because it might give the impression to the outside world that we are beginning to make rather imperialistic demands. All our lives we’ve opposed imperialism—let’s not give our youth a taste or spirit of imperialism..."*

Hatta was also the one who **saved us as human beings** for the future.

It was Hatta, strongly backed by Yamin, who **demanded that the rights of citizens be explicitly written into the constitution**. He already sensed the danger of reducing citizens to mere *people* with duties, rather than recognizing them as *human beings* with rights that must be constitutionally guaranteed.

Later, during the **PRRI/PERMESTA rebellion**, Hatta refused to support the separatists, yet he also **firmly rejected any militaristic solution**. His first stance showed his commitment to a united Indonesia. But his second stance reflected a deeper principle: that even in the face of rebellion, **citizens must still be treated with humanity**.

## When the Lone Voice Echoes the Loudest
History remembers Hatta not just as a founding father, but as a **statesman who saw a nation not merely as a matter of territorial boundaries—but as a question of how we treat the people within them**.

Amid the euphoria of building a new state, he was the lone voice warning against becoming a nation of conquerors. His views may have seemed out of place back then, but they hold a powerful relevance today:

> That the ideal of unity without justice and respect for human dignity is nothing more than a shadow of power.

**Hatta may have lost the vote—but he won the reason of history.**
