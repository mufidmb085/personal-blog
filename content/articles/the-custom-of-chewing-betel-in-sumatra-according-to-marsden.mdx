Most nations have a custom of mastication the substances possessing an inebriating. This custom has been described by various writer. The Sumatran people is one of the nations with this culture which they called it betel (sirih) chewing as written in The History of Sumatra by William Marsden.

According to Marsden, the custom of betel chewing is an integral part of the Sumatran social culture. This custom is universal among the Sumatran people, both from the nobles to ordinary people, as Marsden notes "The Sumatrans universally use it, carry the ingredients constantly about them, and serve it to their guests on all occasions--the prince in a gold stand, and the poor man in a brass box or mat bag." This indicates that the custom not just as personal habit, but holds significant social dimensions. For instance, serving betel to a guest demonstrates the host’s friendliness and is a key part of etiquette.

In addition, serving betel have symbolic value in reflecting social hierarchy. Nobles serve betel using gold or silver plates, while ordinary people serve betel using simpler plates, "the betel-stands of the better rank of people are usually of silver embossed with rude figures." This difference highlights how betel shows social status. Furthermore, Marsden describes the importance of betel in myths, like if we don't serve or we reject betel it considered as insulation. "To omit it on the one hand or to reject it on the other would be an affront," he writes.

Marsden also describes the physical effects of this custom on the Sumatrans. Regular chewing often changes the appearance of the mouth, such as the red color produced by mixing betel leaf (sirih), areca nut (pinang), and lime (kapur), which is considered decorative. Marsden notes, "This hue being communicated to the mouth and lips is esteemed ornamental." However, he also mentions the physical consequences, such as loosening teeth as people age, writing, "It is common to see the teeth of elderly persons stand loose in the gums, which is probably the effect of this custom." Nevertheless, Marsden is uncertain whether betel chewing is harmful to health, speculating that its effects may differ for those unaccustomed to the practice.

Marsden also touches local beliefs about how they use betel in a part of their spirituality, although Marsden doubt about it. "Along with the betel, and generally in the chunam, is the mode of conveying philtres, or love charms. How far they prove effectual I cannot take upon me to say." It seems betel have multiple role in Sumatran people, from social to spiritual.

Also, noting that betel is sometimes used in spiritual practices, although he expresses doubt about its effectiveness. He writes, "Along with the betel, and generally in the chunam, is the mode of conveying philtres, or love charms. How far they prove effectual I cannot take upon me to say." This suggests that betel has multiple roles in Sumatran society, from social interaction to spiritual use.

Overall, Marsden’s analysis of betel chewing shows that it is not merely a personal habit but a key part of the complex Sumatran culture. Through its roles as a symbol, a medium for social interaction, and a part of spirituality, betel connects various aspects of Sumatran life.
